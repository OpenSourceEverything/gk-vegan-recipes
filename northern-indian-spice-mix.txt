INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================

STEP 1: PREPARE WHOLE SPICES
1. Remove cardamom seeds from green pods, discard pods
2. Break cinnamon stick into smaller pieces
3. Remove stems from dried chilies if using
4. Check all spices for stones/debris

STEP 2: DRY ROAST WHOLE SPICES (CRITICAL STEP)
1. Heat heavy pan over medium-low heat (no oil)
2. Add larger spices first: cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom pods
3. Toast 1 minute, then add: coriander, cumin, fennel
4. Add cloves, peppercorns, chilies - toast 2-3 more minutes total
5. Shake pan constantly - spices should become fragrant, not burnt
6. Look for: Light browning, strong aroma, slight popping sounds
7. Remove from heat immediately when aromatic (don't over-roast!)

STEP 3: COOL COMPLETELY
1. Transfer to plate, spread in single layer
2. Cool 10-15 minutes (prevents moisture in grinder)
3. Remove bay leaves and any cardamom pod shells

STEP 4: GRIND ROASTED SPICES
1. Grind roasted whole spices in small batches for even texture
2. Pulse first, then continuous grinding
3. Sift through fine mesh, re-grind larger pieces
4. Aim for fine powder, no visible chunks

STEP 5: ADD POWDER SPICES
1. Add amchur, turmeric, ginger powder, hing, and black salt
2. Pulse 2-3 times to mix evenly
3. Do NOT grind these powders extensively

STEP 6: STORE PROPERLY
