================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================

STEP 1: MAKE SEITAN BASE
1. Whisk all dry ingredients in large bowl
2. Blend wet ingredients until smooth (make extra wet/liquid consistency)
3. CRITICAL: Pour wet mix into dry, stir QUICKLY - becomes very hard to mix after 1 minute
4. Work fast to combine into shaggy dough, then knead immediately
5. Knead on flat surface 2-3 minutes until elastic and smooth
6. Optional: Freeze dough 30 minutes for easier slicing

**MIXING TIP: VWG hydrates rapidly and becomes difficult to work. Ensure wet ingredients are very liquid (thin consistency) and combine with dry ingredients as quickly as possible. Do not let mixed dough sit - knead immediately.**

STEP 2: COOK SEITAN (Choose Method)
PRESSURE COOKER METHOD (Recommended):
- Wrap dough in foil, seal edges
- Pressure cook on high 45 minutes
- Natural release

OVEN METHOD:
- Wrap in foil, seal tightly
- Bake 375°F for 45-60 minutes
- Cool completely before unwrapping

STEP 3: SLICE & MARINATE
1. Slice seitan into 3-4mm thick strips (kitchen scissors work well)
2. Marinate strips 20-60 minutes in chosen marinade
3. Reserve extra marinade for basting

================================================================================
DEHYDRATING METHODS:
================================================================================

METHOD 1: DEHYDRATOR (Best Results)
1. Arrange strips on dehydrator trays with space between
2. Set to 130°F (55°C) - same as meat jerky setting
3. Dehydrate 2-3 hours for chewy texture
4. Check after 2 hours, then every 15 minutes
5. Test: should bend without breaking, not be brittle

METHOD 2: OVEN (Low Temperature)
1. Preheat oven to 200-250°F (use lowest setting)
2. Line baking sheets with parchment
3. Arrange strips with space between
4. Prop oven door slightly open for moisture escape
5. Bake 1-2 hours, flipping halfway
6. Brush with reserved marinade after flipping

METHOD 3: OVEN (Ultra-Low for Crispy)
1. Set oven to 100°C fan (212°F) or 80°C regular (176°F)
2. Brush strips with marinade, place on trays
3. Bake 30 minutes, flip, brush again, bake 30 more
4. Check texture - should be chewy, not brittle
5. Cool 5-10 minutes before eating

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING & TIPS:
================================================================================

TEXTURE ISSUES:
- Too tough/rubbery: Add more liquid or cook seitan longer
- Too soft: Dehydrate longer or use less liquid
- Crumbly: Don't over-knead, ensure proper hydration

FLAVOR IMPROVEMENTS:
- Double-marinate: Once before cooking, once before dehydrating
- Inject marinade into thicker pieces with syringe
- Add umami with MSG, mushroom powder, or more soy sauce

STORAGE:
- Room temp: 3-5 days in airtight container
- Refrigerated: Up to 1 week
- Freezer: Up to 3 months
- Re-crisp in low oven if needed
